1. OS and features:
   - User or user application can communicate with system hardware only through the kernel layer.
   - The core part of an Operating System is called Kernel.
   
1.1 Features of an OS:
    - Process management
    - Memory management
    - I/O system management
    - Secondary storage management
    - Network interface
    - User interface
    - File management
    - Protection and Security

1.2 Embedded Linux:
   - An embedded system in which the Linux OS is operating the hardware is called an Embedded Linux System.
   - Kernel Subsystems:
      1) Process management – Schedule all the processes and control multitasking
      2) Memory Management – Manages the physical memory and provides memory mapping, shared virtual memory, swapping etc.
      3) File system Management – Manages the file system including device files
      4) Inter-Process Communication – Manages and control the communication between various processes
      5) Network Interface – Provides network access to the Linux machine via protocols like TCP, UDP, IPV4, IPV6 etc
      6) Device driver – It forms a medium for the communication between various processes with the actual hardware.
   
1.3 Why arm is widely used:
   - ARM processor has a RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) based architecture
   - Highly power efficient compared to other kind of processors
   - ARM instruction set architecture Licensing allows companies to custom built their ARM based processor
   - RISC architecture enables ARM processor to operate at higher clock frequencies.
   - High code density is a significant factor since embedded devices have limited memory
   - ARM doesn’t have BIOS, the kernel is directly loaded from the flash 
   - ARM has on-chip debugging capability

2. Linux Porting:
   - The term OS porting means to modify or customize an OS, which is running on particular hardware architecture, in such a way that it can run on another particular kind of architecture when loaded into one.
   
2.1 Hardware:
   - Processor, ROM, RAM, disk storage, peripherals.
   
2.2 Firmware:
   - ARM Firmware Suite (AFS) is a firmware package developed by ARM. It support various ARM boards and processors. It has two major parts:
      - Hardware Abstraction Layer called HAL
      - A debug monitor called Angel.
   
2.3 Boot Loader:
   - It is small dependent code, which runs before the main kernel.
   Types of bootloader:
      - Compaq's bootldr
      - Blob
      - RedBoot - support all architecture like ARM, x86, etc.
      - U-Boot - universal bootloader based on PPCBOOT and ARMBoot.
